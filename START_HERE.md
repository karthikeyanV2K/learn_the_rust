## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Make Mistakes On Purpose
After you solve a problem:
- Break the code intentionally
- See what error you get
- Learn from the error
- Fix it

### Tip 2: Do the BONUS CHALLENGES
They're not optional - they teach you:
- Deeper understanding
- Different patterns
- Real-world usage

### Tip 3: Take Breaks
Learning works better when you rest:
- After completing 10 problems
- When you hit a wall
- When frustrated
- After achievements

### Tip 4: Code Out Loud
Explain what you're typing:
- "Now I'm creating a mutable variable"
- "This function takes a reference"
- Reinforces learning

---

## 📱 Quick Reference

### Compile & Run
```bash
rustc problem.rs
.\problem.exe
```

### Check Syntax Only
```bash
cargo check
```

### See Common Errors
Read the error message! It tells you exactly what's wrong.

### Get Help
1. Read error message
2. Check problem comments
3. Look at solutions
4. Search online
